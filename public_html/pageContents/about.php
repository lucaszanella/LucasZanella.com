	<h1 align="center"> About </h1>
		My name is Lucas Zanella. I'm 19 and I study math at Unesp in Brazil. I also study computer science in parallel, so I can integrate both theories in my projects. I have a project in youtube called <a href='http://youtube.com/academiazanella' target="_blank">Academia Zanella</a>, where I post free lectures on math and CS (unfortunately I do it in portuguese only). My main channel is called <a href='http://youtube.com/geekionizado' target="_blank">geekionizado</a>, it is about robotics and it is in english (so I can reach larger audience).
        <p>And, of course:</p>
